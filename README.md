Q1

Get The Weather Using An API

In this question, we ask you create a single web page that is completely self-contained (i.e. does not load any external JavaScript files) 
and retrieve the current local weather using a free online service.  
There are several free weather service providers available; 
it's up to you to find one, study its API, figure out what endpoint to use, and write the JavaScript code to retrieve the current weather for Calgary.  
You will need to figure out how to decode the response from the API, which will most likely be a JSON-encoded object. 
You should retrieve at least the temperature and a description of the weather (e.g. partially cloudy, sunny, snowing, etc).  
Your web page should display this information, but does not need to be styled at all (i.e. don't waste time making it pretty, 
just display the weather by updating HTML DOM elements).  Please make sure your HTML page validates through W3C and do not use document.write at all!

Q2.

•	Setup a node-based web server

•	create different API that allow you to search staff information using staff name, id, salary.

•	Write a function that handle the API response and display the data for the user

•	Create an API that register new staff to your existing dataset or to a new file as backend storage. 
Once new record is sent confirmation should be sent back from the server

•	Create an API that will serve as default if wrong API request come to your web server.

•	Use promise, async/await , import and export in this project
